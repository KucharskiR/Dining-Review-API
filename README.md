# Dining-Review-API
## Overiew

A Java RESTful API application created as a summary of my programming learning, built **fully from scratch** and is my first application in my portfolio. The application brings together my skills in **Java** , **SpringBoot** , **SQL**  database operations and the usage of additional frameworks such as Lombok. The application includes a **backend**  and **frontend** .
